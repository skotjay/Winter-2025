        <p>Today we will be learning about HTML and CSS. We will be creating a web page that will be used as a reference for every page we will ever make, ever. We will also be learning about the different elements that can be used in HTML. We will also be learning about links and how to use them. We will also be learning about how to use images as links. We will also be learning about comments and how to use them in HTML. I am in this class and am typing and typing, just to make words. Only because this is slightly more fun.</p>
